# Console_Program_Biblioteque

This is a small console program showing the way how to add data like title,  author, year to the JSON file and how to interact with it. You can see that I use uuid4 for creating ID. Also you can see the file test.py where I mock some behaviour of the program for testing purposes.

About functionality: in this application you can add and delete data, change status, search information.

## First steps

Let's watch how to start application development, based on this template. 


First, we need to get the sources:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AlexanderBeli/Console_Program_Biblioteque.git
$ cd ./Console_Program_Biblioteque
```
Second, we need to launch it:

```shell
$ python3 main.py
```
 
Follow the instructions on the screen.

## Tests

I used two testing methods: unittest in tests.py and manual testing.
